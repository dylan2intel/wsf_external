+
+    **KubeVirt** is a virtual machine management add-on for Kubernetes.
+    The aim is to provide a common ground for virtualization solutions on top of
+    Kubernetes.
+
+    # Virtualization extension for Kubernetes
+
+    At its core, KubeVirt extends [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) by adding
+    additional virtualization resource types (especially the `VirtualMachine` type) through
+    [Kubernetes's Custom Resource Definitions API](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-kubernetes-api/extend-api-custom-resource-definitions/).
+    By using this mechanism, the Kubernetes API can be used to manage these `VirtualMachine`
+    resources alongside all other resources Kubernetes provides.
+
+    The resources themselves are not enough to launch virtual machines.
+    For this to happen the _functionality and business logic_ needs to be added to
+    the cluster. The functionality is not added to Kubernetes itself, but rather
+    added to a Kubernetes cluster by _running_ additional controllers and agents
+    on an existing cluster.
+
+    The necessary controllers and agents are provided by KubeVirt.
+
+    As of today KubeVirt can be used to declaratively
+
+      * Create a predefined VM
+      * Schedule a VM on a Kubernetes cluster
+      * Launch a VM
+      * Migrate a VM
+      * Stop a VM
+      * Delete a VM
+
+    # Start using KubeVirt
+
+      * Try our quickstart at [kubevirt.io](http://kubevirt.io/get_kubevirt/).
+      * See our user documentation at [kubevirt.io/docs](http://kubevirt.io/user-guide).
+
+    # Start developing KubeVirt
+
+    To set up a development environment please read our
+    [Getting Started Guide](https://github.com/kubevirt/kubevirt/blob/main/docs/getting-started.md).
+    To learn how to contribute, please read our [contribution guide](https://github.com/kubevirt/kubevirt/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).
+
+    You can learn more about how KubeVirt is designed (and why it is that way),
+    and learn more about the major components by taking a look at our developer documentation:
