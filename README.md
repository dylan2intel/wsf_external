### Introduction

This is the **Workload Services Framework** repository. The repository contains a set of workloads optimized for Intel(R) Xeon(R) platforms. See the list of supported workloads under the [workload](workload) directory.  

### Setup

- Sync your system date/time. This is required by any credential authorization.  
- If you are behind a corporate firewall, please setup `http_proxy`, `https_proxy` and `no_proxy` in `/etc/environment`.
- Run the [`setup-dev.sh`](doc/user-guide/preparing-infrastructure/setup-wsf.md#setup-devsh) script to setup the development host for Cloud and On-Premises workload development and evaluation. See [Cloud and On-Premises Setup](doc/user-guide/preparing-infrastructure/setup-wsf.md) for more details on the setup.
  
### Evaluate Workload

Evaluate any workload as follows:  

```
mkdir build 
cd build
cmake ..                               # .. is required here
cd workload/OpenSSL-RSAMB              # Go to any workload folder
./ctest.sh -N                          # List all test cases
./ctest.sh -R test_openssl_rsamb_sw_rsa -V  # Evaluate a specific test case
./list-kpi.sh logs*                    # Show KPIs
```

---

- The WSF supports multiple validation backends. By default, the [`docker`](doc/user-guide/preparing-infrastructure/setup-docker.md) backend, or the [`Kubernetes`](doc/user-guide/preparing-infrastructure/setup-kubernetes.md) backend if available, is used to evaluate any workload locally. To evaluate workloads on Cloud or in an on-premises cluster, please use the [terraform](doc/user-guide/preparing-infrastructure/setup-terraform.md) backend. Additional setup required such as configuring Cloud account credentials.

---

### Build Workload

```
mkdir -p build
cd build
cmake -DREGISTRY= -DBENCHMARK=ResNet-50 ..
cd workload/ResNet-50
make
./ctest.sh -N
```

> TIP: You can specify `BENCHMARK` to limit the repository scope to the specified workload. The build and test operations on all other workloads are disabled. See [Build Options](doc/user-guide/executing-workload/cmake.md) for details.

```
cd build
cmake -DBENCHMARK=ResNet-50
make
./ctest.sh -N
```
