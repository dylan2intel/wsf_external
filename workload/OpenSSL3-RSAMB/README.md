### Introduction

This is the speed test in the OpenSSL software, integrated with the QAT software stack.

### Test Case

- **rsa**: This test case meausres the RSA cipher performance. `|QAT_HW & QAT_SW|`
- **dsa**: This test case meausres the DSA cipher performance. `|QAT_HW & QAT_SW|`
- **ecdsa**: This test case meausres the ECDSA cipher performance. `|QAT_HW & QAT_SW|`
- **ecdh**: This test case measures the ECDH (x25519) cipher performance. `|QAT_HW & QAT_SW|`
- **aes-sha**: This test case measures AES-GCM cipher performance. `|QAT_HW & QAT_SW|`
- **aes-gcm**: This test case measures AES-GCM cipher performance. `|QAT_HW & QAT_SW|`
- **prf**: This test case measures PRF cipher performance. `|QAT_HW|`
- **hkdf**: This test case measures HKDF cipher performance. `|QAT_HW|`
- **ecx**: This test case measures ECX cipher performance. `|QAT_HW|`
- **dh**: This test case measures DH cipher performance. `|QAT_HW|`
- **chachapoly**: This test case measures CHACHA-POLY cipher performance. `|QAT_HW|`

For each test case, there are a few variations: `sw`, `qatsw` and `qathw`. The `sw` test case is the default performance from the OpenSSL software. The `qatsw` test case is the performance optimized with QAT (`IPPMB` and `IPSECMB`). The `qathw` test case is optimized with QAT HW v2.0.

### Docker Image

The workload provides the following docker images: `openssl3-rsamb-qat-sw` and `spr-openssl3-rsamb-qat-hw`. The `-qat-sw` image must be used to run the software or hardware `qat-` test cases and in edition can also run `sw-*` test cases as well. There is an additional `qathw-setup` image that is used to setup the QAT device.

The workload supports the following environment variables:
- **`CONFIG`**: Specify the workload configuration: `(sw|qatsw|qathw)-(rsa|dsa|ecdsa|ecdh|aes-sha)`.
- **`ASYNC_JOBS`**: Specify the number of asynchronous submissions. Default 64.
- **`PROCESSES`**: Specify the number of processes. Default 8.

```
mkdir -p logs-sw-rsa
id=$(docker run --rm --detach -e CONFIG=sw-rsa openssl3-rsamb-qat-sw)
docker exec $id cat /export-logs | tar xf - -C logs-sw-rsa
docker rm -f $id
```

```
mkdir -p logs-qatsw-rsa
id=$(docker run --rm --detach -e CONFIG=qatsw-rsa openssl3-rsamb-qat-sw)
docker exec $id cat /export-logs | tar xf - -C logs-qatsw-rsa
```
### KPI

Run the [`kpi.sh`](kpi.sh) script to parse the KPIs from the validation logs. The script takes the following command line argument:

```
Usage: (sw|qatsw)-(rsa|dsa|ecdsa|ecdh|aes-sha|aes-gcm)
Usage: (sw|qatsw|qathw)-(rsa|dsa|ecdsa|ecdh|aes-sha|aes-gcm|dh|hkdf|prf|ecx|chachapoly)
```

#### RSA/DSA/ECDSA KPI

- **`sign (s)`**: The signing time measured in seconds.
- **`sign/s`**: The signing throughput in terms of # of signing operations per second.
- **`verify (s)`**: The verification time measured in seconds.
- **`verify/s`**: The verification throughput in terms of # of verification operations per second.

#### ECDH KPI

- **`op (s)`**: The cipher time measured in seconds.
- **`op/s`**: The cipher throughput in terms of # of operations per second.

#### AES KPI

- **`(k)`**: The cipher throughput.
